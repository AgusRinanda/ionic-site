  <h3 class="text-center">Frequently asked questions</h3>
  <ul class="items left">
    <li class="item">
      <h4>What’s the difference between a development build and a release build?</h4>
      <p>
        The Ionic Package service takes your Ionic project files and converts 
        them into native APK and IPA files that are ready to submit to the App 
        Stores. Development builds are native builds that allow you to install 
        your app on a device for test and dev purposes only. The app icon and 
        splash screen are both Ionic branded.  Release builds are native builds 
        that are meant to be deployed to the App Stores. With release builds, 
        you can customize the app icon and splash screen with your own branding. 
        Release builds also use a specific certification that is meant for 
        production release to the App Stores; whereas, development builds use 
        debug certs that cannot be used in the App Stores.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4>What is a live deploy?</h4>
      <p>
        Using the Ionic Deploy service, live deploys allow you to push hot code 
        updates to devices running your apps directly from the Ionic Pro 
        dashboard, without having to go through the App Stores. Each device 
        updated once counts as a single live deploy. For the Kickstarter plan, 
        you can have up to 20 updates sent to devices per month. All of our paid 
        plans include a higher number of live deploys free with each plan, and 
        the ability to scale to unlimited deploys as part of our metered billing
        service.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4>What is error monitoring?</h4>
      <p>
        Ionic Monitor provides error catching and stack trace capabilities so 
        you can identify errors and pinpoint the portions of your code that 
        require updates. The Kickstarter plan offers limited error monitoring 
        with 100 events per month included for free. Starting with the Developer 
        plan, we offer advanced error monitoring with unlimited event tracking.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4>What is a channel?</h4>
      <p>
        A Channel points to a specific build of your app that will be shared 
        with specific testers and users. You can change which build a Channel 
        points to whenever you'd like, and can rollback changes as well. 
        Channels are used for both Ionic View and Ionic Deploy. See below for 
        more detail.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4>How do Channels work with Deploy?</h4>
      <p>
        When using Deploy to push live updates to your users’ devices, you first 
        select the associated Channel and build version. Developer plans are 
        restricted to a single channel for live updating with Deploy. Starting 
        with the Business plan, you can set up multiple channels and use the 
        Deploy service to push live updates of different versions to each 
        channel.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="items right">
    <li class="item">
      <h4>How does public and private sharing with the View App work?</h4>
      <p>
        The Ionic View App is the easiest way to get your app in the hands of 
        testers and collaborators. Starting with the Developer plan, apps are 
        private by default and can be shared via a simple email invite. With the 
        Kickstarter plan, apps are publicly accessible. You can invite testers 
        simply by sharing the App Id and inviting them to download the View App.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4>What are Test Groups?</h4>
      <p>
        Test Groups allow for easy sharing of app versions through the View App. 
        You can set up groups to target specific audiences, such as internal 
        departments like Marketing and QA, or outside clients if you’re working 
        as part of an agency. After sharing an app with View, Test Groups will 
        get notified when new versions are available for them to check out and 
        provide feedback on. Test Groups are offered as part of our Business and 
        Enterprise plans.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4>What is split testing?</h4>
      <p>
        With Business and Enterprise plans, you can use multiple development 
        channels to share different versions of your app with View. For example, 
        you can share stable versions of your app with the Marketing department 
        to get their feedback on new features, while allowing your QA team to 
        test the latest bug fixes on a more recent version.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4>What’s included in the Teams & Organizations feature?</h4>
      <p>
        Teams and organizations allows you to invite development team members, 
        testers, and other collaborators, to participate in app development and 
        track the progress of your projects. Granular permissions allow Ionic 
        Pro administrators to add and remove team members and control who has 
        access to which projects.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4>What’s the difference between Developer, Business, and Enterprise?</h4>
      <p>
        Our paid plans offer varying levels of services and usage limits that 
        are designed to meet the needs of different audiences. The Developer 
        plan is ideal for serious app builders looking to accelerate development 
        and build higher quality apps.  The Business plan offers a complete app 
        building platform for teams and organizations working collaboratively or 
        with larger scale apps.  Finally, the Enterprise plan is targeted at 
        larger organizations that want the peace of mind of additional support 
        services and training, simplified licensing and custom billing.
