## How it Works

The Ionic CLI will combine each starter template with its [base template](#base-templates) to provide a new project the files it needs to start development. See the [`ionic start`](/docs/cli/start/) docs for more information.

## Base Templates

Project Type |
-------------|
`ionic-angular` | [https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base)
`ionic1` | [https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-base)
