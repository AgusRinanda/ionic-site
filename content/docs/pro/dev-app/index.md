# Using the Ionic Developer App

The Ionic Developer App is a free app that makes it easy to run your Ionic app directly on your device.

Skip dealing with frustrating Native SDK installation issues, just run `ionic serve`, open the Developer App, connect to the same network, and the app will automatically load
and run your app. The Developer App comes with many native plugins built right in, so you don't need to worry about installing plugins.

# Download the Developer App

The Developer App is available on iOS and Android.
