# Live Deployment

Ionic Pro's Live Deploy feature let you update the UI and business logic of your app remotely, in real-time. Push HTML, JS, and CSS updates directly to your users without going through the
app store to quickly fix bugs and ship new features.

This enables you to

* Update your application on demand
* Skip app store approvals
* Get new features and bug fixes to your users quickly
* A/B test changes with certain users before rolling them out to everyone


## Installation

The Ionic Deploy Plugin manages fetching and applying remote app updates. To use Ionic Pro's Deploy feature, install the plugin for your app:

```bash
cordova plugin add ionic-plugin-deploy@alpha --save --variable APP_ID="APP_ID" --variable CHANNEL_NAME="CHANNEL" --variable AUTO_UPDATE="true"
```

Where `APP_ID` is the id of your app from the Ionic Pro dashboard. `CHANNEL` is the specific [Channel](concepts.html#channels) to use for updates, and `AUTO_UPDATE` indicates whether the plugin should automatically fetch and apply new app updates (default is true).

## Usage

To push new updates to your app, first push a new build using the [Git Workflow](git.html). This will create a new build viewable in the Ionic Pro dashboard.

To get that new build live in your app using Deploy, there are two options. Either manually deploy the build to the channel defined in the plugin above (the "Production" channel, by default), or, if you have specified a specific git branch channel to auto-deploy, the Deploy plugin will auto update once the build has completed.

## Deploy Plugin API

When using `AUTO_UPDATE="true"`, the plugin manages updates for you. If you'd like to manually control updates, the Deploy plugin has a number of functions available to manage the update lifecycle.

See the [Deploy manual example]() for an example of using the plugin directly:

`IonicDeploy.init(app_id, server_host, success, failure)`

Initializes the plugin with an app ID and API host specified in js-land.  Can be used to change these variables at runtime

`IonicDeploy.check(app_id, channel_tag, success, failure)`

Check for updates from a specified channel, will change the saved channel from the install step

`IonicDeploy.download(app_id, success, failure)`

If an update is present, download it

`IonicDeploy.extract(app_id, success, failure)`

If an update has been downloaded, extract it and set the default redirect location for next app start.

`IonicDeploy.redirect(app_id, success, failure)`

Redirect to the latest version of the app on this device.

`IonicDeploy.info(app_id, success, failure)`

Get info on current version for this device.

`IonicDeploy.getVersions(app_id, success, failure)`

List downloaded versions on this device.

`IonicDeploy.deleteVersion(app_id, uuid, success, failure)`

Delete a downloaded version by UUID from this device.
