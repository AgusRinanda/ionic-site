# Migrate from Ionic Cloud

Below you'll find guides and resources to help you get your app moved over from the Ionic Cloud dashboard to the new Ionic Pro service

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h3>Migrating from Ionic Cloud to Ionic Pro is a manual process.</h3>But it's easy! Follow along and we'll make sure you're up to speed in no time.</div>

## Legacy Paid Plans

If you were paying for Ionic Cloud, then your login has been migrated over to the new Ionic Pro dashboard! Send an email to <a href="mailto:help@ionic.io">help@ionic.io</a> to migrate your paid plan to the new Pro service.

To start using your new account, just head over to [dashboard.ionicjs.com](https://dashboard.ionicjs.com/apps) and log in with your existing Cloud credentials.

<p class="paid-notice">
  Ionic Pro is a new service, so once you start using the new dashboard, any changes you make to your account may not be reflected on the legacy dashboard.
</p>

## Moving Apps to the new service

To move your apps over to the new dashboard, just link them by following the steps [here](/docs/pro/getting-started.html#linking-an-existing-app).

## Services to Migrate
