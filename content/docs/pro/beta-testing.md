# Beta Testing with Ionic View

Ionic View makes it easy to distribute versions of your app to beta testers, clients, co-workers, and more, without dealing with the complicated device provisioning and configuration required with traditional beta testing services.

In order to share & test with Ionic View, you'll have to push any code up to Ionic Pro that you'd like to share with [git push ionic master](/docs/pro/git.html#pushing-new-builds).

## Install Ionic View

As a Developer with an Ionic Pro account, you can log into your own account in View to access your projects. You can download Ionic View for [iOS]() and [Android]().

If you are working with testers, the email they receive inviting them to look at your App will include these links and help get them set up.

## Using Channels with Ionic View

In order to test anything in Ionic View, you will have to assign your Builds to a Channel. These Channels are what you will use to share a version of your app with someone.

For instance, you could set up a **Staging** Channel that you can share with your QA Testers, a **Marketing Preview** Channel that you can share with the Marketing department to give them an early preview, a **Public** Channel to be shared with anyone via a QR code, etc.

You have complete control over these Channels and what Build is set to active for them. If you push a new build to **Staging**, anyone who has been given access to that Channel will be able to see the update right in Ionic View.
