Ionic Pro's Live Deploy feature let you update the UI and business logic of your app remotely, in real-time. Push HTML, JS, and CSS updates directly to your users without going through the
app store to quickly fix bugs and ship new features.

This enables you to

* Update your application on demand
* Avoid app store publishing for many fixes
* Get new features and bug fixes to your users quickly
* A/B test changes with certain users before rolling them out to everyone

## Get started

* [Setup and use the plugin](/docs/pro/deploy/setup/)
* [Learn the plugin API](/docs/pro/deploy/plugin-api.html)
* [Migrate from the legacy Cloud Dashboard](/docs/pro/migration/live-updates.html)
